# Open items

Known gaps in the deployed system that are **not** code defects and have no home in a procedure. Each one is infrastructure that works today and would fail in a way nobody would be told about.

This is a standing register, not a plan: nothing here is scheduled, and an entry earns its place by being something a reader of [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md), [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) or [ADMIN.md](ADMIN.md) would otherwise have to rediscover. Every entry says how to tell whether it is still open, so it can be closed from evidence rather than from memory.

## 1. The SPA shares a Pages origin with another site

**Status: open.** Verified 2026-08-31.

The SPA holds a lecturer's GitHub access token in `sessionStorage`. Browser storage is scoped to an **origin**, and `pxl-digital-application-samples.github.io` is one origin shared by every Pages site the organization publishes. An XSS in any of them runs same-origin with the SPA and can read that token, which reads the private control repo: roster names, student numbers, institutional email addresses.

The organization currently publishes two Pages sites:

```
pxl-classroom            public
security-flag-validator  private repo, Pages published
```

Given its name, the second is exactly the class of application where an injection is plausible.

**Two ways out, in increasing order of effort:**

- **Policy** — nothing else publishes Pages from this organization. Free and immediate, and holds only as long as somebody remembers it, which is why it is written down here rather than agreed in a meeting.
- **A custom domain**, which removes the problem instead of managing it. Settings → Pages → Custom domain on `pxl-classroom`, CNAME to `pxl-digital-application-samples.github.io`, enable **Enforce HTTPS**. The SPA then has an origin no sibling repository can reach. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in [`cors-worker/worker.js`](cors-worker/worker.js) and redeploy the Worker **before** switching, or sign-in breaks at the cutover — the Worker refuses an origin it does not know, which is the control working.

**How to tell it is closed:** either the SPA is on its own domain, or

```bash
gh api "orgs/PXL-Digital-Application-Samples/repos?per_page=100" \
  --jq '.[] | select(.has_pages==true) | .name'
```

returns `pxl-classroom` alone.

## 2. The sign-in Worker is on a personal Cloudflare account

**Status: open.** Verified 2026-08-31.

`pxl-cors.tom-cool-38e.workers.dev` is the **primary** device-flow proxy (`device_flow_proxy` in [`deployment.yml`](deployment.yml)), so it sits on the critical path of every sign-in. It lives in a single-owner Cloudflare account.

If that account is lost, sign-in does not break — it fails over to the third-party secondary and keeps working. That is the problem: the system carries on with a third party seeing every access token, which is the state the ordering exists to prevent, and nobody would be told. System Health warns when the primary does not answer, but not when it answers from an account nobody at PXL can administer.

**Moving it:**

1. Create a Cloudflare account under a PXL address with more than one owner.
2. `cd cors-worker && npx wrangler@latest login && npx wrangler@latest deploy` from that account. Deploy from the repository rather than the dashboard editor — the Worker carries a security allowlist and a pasted copy drifts from the reviewed one.
3. Verify with the probes in [`cors-worker/README.md`](cors-worker/README.md): a browser-origin POST returns a device code, `OPTIONS` answers 204, both allowlists refuse by exact match.
4. Update `device_flow_proxy` in `deployment.yml` and deploy the frontend.
5. Keep the old Worker running for a week — cached bundles still point at it — then delete it.

**How to tell it is closed:** `device_flow_proxy` in `deployment.yml` names a Worker on a shared PXL account.

## Closed

Kept briefly so they are not reopened from memory. Each was verified against the live system on 2026-08-31, not against a changelog.

| Item | Closed by | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Brokers held the provisioning App's private key** | The broker App, plus republishing every live assignment | `gh secret list --repo <org>/broker-<id>` shows `PXL_BROKER_CLIENT_ID` and `PXL_BROKER_PRIVATE_KEY` only. Checked on `PXLAutomation/broker-finalize-drill`; a broker in an org you do not administer returns 403, so confirm the rest as an owner of that org. |
| **`PXL_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` needed rotating after that sweep** | Rotated | The `provisioning` environment secret's `updated_at` is `2026-08-31T13:43:28Z`, after the broker App was created (12:59) and the brokers were migrated (13:13). |
| **Ad-hoc branch creation on the hub was unrestricted** | Ruleset `Block ad-hoc branch creation` | `gh api repos/PXL-Digital-Application-Samples/pxl-classroom/rulesets` returns it `active`, target `branch`, rule `creation`, `~ALL` excluding `refs/heads/participating-orgs`, bypass for OrganizationAdmin and the repository role — exactly as specified. |
